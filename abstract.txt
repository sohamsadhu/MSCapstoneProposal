Digital signatures are created and verified using cryptographic hash functions. Due to importance and wide
applications NIST has standardised the hash functions that have been named with nomenclature Secure
Hash Algorithm (SHA). NIST has released the draft for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS),
publication 202, that will be used as basis for SHA-3 and uses Keccak function from SHA-3 competition 
as the basis.

Near collision for a hash function, is the agreement of most of the bits of the output of hash function
for two different messages. In this project we compare the security of reduced versions of some SHA-3 competition
finalist hash functions; on the basis of near collisions. For obtaining near collision we apply hill climbing, simulated
annealing, tabu search and random selection algorithms.

All the three hashing functions were found to be equally resistant to near collisions with the above generic
methods used in finding them. Also reduction in state size for Keccak had nominal effect in reducing its
security against generic attacks. We hope, that our experiments provide security margins for reduced hash functions.
