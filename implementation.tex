\chapter{Research Approach and Methodology}

%% Obviously you need to delete these lines when you have written up your text

%(Note: this chapter may be merged with Chapter 2 to have a combined Design 
%and Implementation chapter, if more appropriate.)

%\begin{itemize}
%\item{} Software details (use as many section as needed for class design, 
%database tables, middleware, etc.)

%\item{} Make sure you present and comment on any interesting issues about
%your implementation that you are proud of or unhappy with

%\item{} Skip code listing and specific UML diagrams, etc. to an appendix

%\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture}


\section{Platform, Languages and Tools}
Well for starters, my platform will be Ubuntu Linux and will try to make it work on the CS systems at RIT. So the
C++ or Go-lang will be selected for implemenation and experimentation based on what I can do or not.

\section{Proposed schedule}
Well once I give away my proposal. Then the clock starts. Week 1, try to get the things going. Implementation of all
the three algorithms if possible in 1 and 1/2 week. Next, 1 week look at the zero sum distinguisher implementation
and how to get the things done. Next 1 week do the input and output and at the same time keep writing the report in
parallel.
