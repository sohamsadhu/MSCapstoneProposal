%For the time being, here is my hypothesis, or the premise of my question. Keccak has been selected over BLAKE and
%Groestl for what? Is there is a basis that Keccak's property is still comparitively immune to zero sum distinguisher
%compared to BLAKE and Groestl in the reduced versions. This is what, I would like to find out and examine.

\section{Observations}
The experiment first subjected all the 3 SHA-3 finalist algorithm to hill climbing, simulated annealing, and
random selection; for permutation rounds of 1, 2, 3. The chaining value length was kept at 32 bits; and all
the possible four message digest sizes were evaluated. Tabu search algorithm was applied only to Gr{\o}stl
for rounds 1 and 2, for digest size of 224 bits. At first time, each collision finding algorithm was given
128 trials of experiment, for each hashing algorithm for a particular digest size and permutation round and
input class. The experiment, was again conducted as mentioned; but with chaining value of length 64 bits. Since
tabu search had previously proved to be expensive, with absence of encouraging results; it was discontinued.
The experiment on random selection was not done, since hill climbing and simulated annealing took much longer
time, than it took for the chaining value of 64 bits, and even that was discontinued. Since the results from
the 64 bit length chaining value weren't that encouraging, hence we stuck to chaining value of bit length 32.
We this time repeated our experiment, but with 256 trials instead of 128 trials, and experimented with rounds
of 3 and 4. All the following observations and numbers can be found on the 
\href{https://github.com/sxs9174/MSProjectCode/tree/master/MSProjectCode/Output}{git repository} for the source
code implementation of the experiment.

\subsection{Choice of programming language}

Java comes as not the best choice in implementing algorithms related to hashing. Although since this experiment 
required GUI, and platform compatibility which made Java ideal tool. The SHA-3 finalist algorithms have word size
or state size parameters of 32 or 64 bits, which exploit the computer architecture of having these word sizes
built in or used, and using them as single data entities. In languages like C, there are primitive data types
of size 4 bytes or 8 bytes, which can be easily integrated into the hashing algorithm. Java also has similar
word size, but by default the data type is always signed. This creates problems while bit shifting or implementing
some of the modulus operations. The leading bit is zero and during bit shifts if the bit is toggled to 1, then 
the data in it will treated as negative number, due to which some of the optimizations cannot be performed easily.
