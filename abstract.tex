  Hash functions, have \href{"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic\_hash\_function\#Applications"}
  {applications in computer security}, in fields of authentication and integrity.
  Due to importance of hash function usage in everyday computing, standards for using hashing 
  algorithm and their bit size have been released by \href{"http://www.nist.gov/index.html"}
  {(NIST)} which are denoted by nomenclature Standard Hashing Algorithm (SHA).

  Due to advances in cryptanalysis of SHA-2, NIST announced a competition in November, 2007 
  to choose SHA-3. In October, 2012 the winner was selected to be \href{"http://keccak.noekeon.org/"}
  {Keccak} amongst 64 submissions. All the submissions were open to public scrutiny, and underwent
  intensive third party cryptanalysis, before the winner was selected. 
  \href{"http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/sha-3\_selection\_announcement.pdf"}{Keccak was chosen}
   for its flexibility, efficient and elegant implementation, and large security margin.

  All algorithms submitted to competition have undergone public scrutiny. And other four finalist in 
  the competition were almost equivalent to Keccak, in attributes of security margin and implementation.
  In this project, I will be comparing Keccak with two other SHA-3 finalists, \href{"https://131002.net/blake/"}
  {BLAKE}, and \href{"http://www.groestl.info/"}{Gr$\o$stl} with respect to their resistance to 
  \href{"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated\_annealing"}{simulated annealing} and 
  \href{"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu\_search"}{tabu search}.
  
  Application of tabu search and simulated annealing to hash algorithms will be akin to generic attacks.
  That is these methods of breaking hash functions are design agnostic or do not depend on the workings
  of the hash function. Thus ensuring no bias in the experiment. At present, it is computationally infeasible
  to break the above mentioned hash functions. But the reduced versions of these can be subjected to attacks
  for near collisions. Thus I will be able to examine and conclude, if reduced instance Keccak has better 
  resistance to generic attacks than reduced instance of BLAKE and Gr$\o$stl.
