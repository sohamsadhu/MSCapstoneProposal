  Keccak, a hashing cryptographic algorithm, was subjected to various cryptanalysis before it was
  selected as latest standard for hashing in SHA-3. Though Keccak became the new SHA-3 based on 
  the fact that it won the NIST competition that was set up for that purpose, but the claim of other
  contenders cannot be just ignored. In my project proposal I intend to study one of the cryptanalysis
  that was successfully implemented on reduced version of Keccak and another finalist in the NIST
  competition. Doing so, will give us an idea as to how much the other finalist was lacking, or 
  in reduced versions do other finalist stand head to head with Keccak.
