\chapter{Evaluation and expected outcomes}

So I will be running experimenting with the same inputs, on all three of the algorithms and then will try and check for 
how much of preimage can I figure out for them. So there will be comparative graphs of all three. But this does not give
a complete picture given, that they have different rounds and structure, so you really cannot make a comparison given
that different algorithms reduced to different strengths. So this I will have to clear with my advisor.
